# üéì About Me
I'm an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), pursuing a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Automation (expected Jun 2026). Currently, I serve as a research intern with the [UIUC Ulab](https://ulab-uiuc.github.io/) & OpenManus Team under the guidance of Prof. [Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jiaxuan/), where my research focuses on multi-agent systems, GUI agents, and agentic reinforcement learning. Prior to this, I completed a research internship at [SJTU CMIC](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Default.aspx), advised by Prof. [Siheng Chen](https://siheng-chen.github.io/).

<span style="color: red;">I am actively seeking PhD/Research Assistant positions or collaboration opportunities in multimodal agents and world models. I would be truly honored and excited to connect with anyone interested in these areas‚Äîplease don't hesitate to reach out!</span>

## Research interests
My current research centers around the following domains:
- Multimodal Agentic Learning and Reasoning
- World Models For Multimodal Agents
- Multi-Agent System Design

and many other topics like tool-integrated reasoning, spatial reasoning...
