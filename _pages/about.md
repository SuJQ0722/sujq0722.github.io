# üòé About Me
I'm an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), pursuing a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Automation (expected Jun 2026). I'm now a research intern with the UIUC Ulab & OpenManus Team, advised by Prof. Jiaxuan You. My work focuses on multi-agent protocols, GUI agent, and agentic reinforcement learning.

## Language Proficiency
- **English**: TOEFL 105 | CET-6 617
- **Chinese**: Native

## Research interests
My current research centers around the following domains:
- Multimodal Agentic Reinforcement Learning
- World Models For Multimodal Agents
- Multi-Agent System Design
