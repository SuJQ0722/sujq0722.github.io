## Overview

This post summarizes recent progress on GUI agents: task formats, environments, common failure modes, and evaluation criteria.

## Datasets and Benchmarks

## Representative works

Prompt-Based:mainly on property models
SFT-Based
RL-Based
<!-- ## Problem Setup
- What is a GUI agent? Typical inputs (screens, DOM, OCR) and outputs (actions, coordinates, key sequences).
- Benchmarks and tasks: form filling, navigation, multi-step workflows.

## Recent Works (Brief)
- Agent architectures: planning + acting, reflection, tool-use, multi-agent collaboration.
- Perception: OCR, layout understanding, vision-language grounding.
- Action spaces: pixel vs. DOM vs. programmatic APIs.

## Design Tips
- Use hierarchical policies (high-level planner + low-level controller).
- Add self-check and rollback strategies.
- Maintain action history and error classifiers. -->

<!-- ## Takeaways
- GUI agents benefit from structured state (DOM/layout) and reliable action abstractions.
- Robustness needs explicit handling of UI variability and error recovery. -->
